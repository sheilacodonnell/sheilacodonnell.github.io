Like tracking the mysterious origins of cultures and historical events, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where this all camd from. I think the ultimate, underlying reason I chose to learn programming is simply a deep curiosity within me. There are a lot of more specific reasons, which I'll share soon, but in it's purest form, that's why. I can't just not know how something works or why it doesn't work. 

In more concrete terms, it was October 2015. At my job, were facing some tech hurdles. Why were so many things broken? Why didn't out website have the sleek and functional features of other websites. 

For many other issues at work, I felt like that even if I couldn't change it, I at least understood where the problem was coming from. This was not the case for our tech problems. I literally had no idea what our problems were, let alone what programmers actually did. What is code? What is all of this stuff? You could have put a gun to my head and I wouldn't have been able to formulate a sentace about what 'tech' is. 

My first true step into the tech world, was a Google search. "What makes a website bad?"

Wow. There's a lot of things apparently. And a lot of jobs dedicated to making websites (among many other things) as beautiful and functional as possible. I was hooked..sort of. I didn't know at the time that I wanted to make a total career change. I just wanted to understand some of this stuff. I feel naive saying this now, but at the time I thought that websites were just created on Photoshop or Illustrator and then directly uploaded to the vast and mysterious internet. 

I started with an online HTML lesson. The first one I tried wasn't great. My simple code didn't work and I gave up almost immediatly. Instead I started thinking about design. These curiosities still started to simmer inside of me, but they took a backseat for a few months. It wasn't until September 2016 that I enrolled in an Adobe Creative class at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. It was a part time night class, but it got my feet sufficiently wet in the digital universe. I felt like I was finally on some sort of track. I had some structure. In early November, I enrolled in an online web development course through Skillcrush. Skillcrush offered a great 101 intro into HTML and CSS. They did a great job of guiding total beginners through the initial stages of 'WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?' 

I used my budding Adobe skills to work on a few side projects and build a portfolio. I also used my new HTML/CSS skills to build informational websites, and email templates. I loved how dymanic the work was. There was always something new to learn. It was never static. 

In spring of 2017 I started to think about programming bootcamps. I felt sufficient in HTML/CSS, but I needed more structure to make the leap into real programming. Long story short, here I am now!
