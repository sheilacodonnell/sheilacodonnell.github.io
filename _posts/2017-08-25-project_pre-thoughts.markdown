I've chugged through quite a lot of OO Ruby this week in order to get to the final project...and now it's hitting me. I'll actually have to do that final project. Build something on my own, without the safety net of tests and structured labs that have helped to guide me thus far.

How. Is. That. Possible. How could anyone trust me? *Me*? To tap away all on their own on the command line, just writing whatever they want. My humble Ruby skills being pushed to the max while I try to cobble together some sembalance of a functional app.

Sometimes when imposter syndrome sneaks in, I think back on how I got to this place. The sneaking imposter syndrome would have me believe that everything has been a coincidence, or an accident so far. Which is absurd if you think about it. You accidently got interseted in tech? You accidently did a bunch of classes and did pretty well in them? You accidently signed up for bootcamp? And accidently got a scholarship? And accidenty made it through the first third of bootcamp with your sanity still intact? 

So, I say to you imposter syndrome, you're not a tool I need to complete this CLI project. I'm sure I'll see you again when you pop up to surprise me. For now, I've got work to do.
