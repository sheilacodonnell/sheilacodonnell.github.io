My Sinatra project was a simple travel app that allowed users to enter, save, edit, and delete data about an upcoming trip.

The first step in the process is Log in/Sign up. I got pretty hung up here for a while later in the project, after all of the other areas of the app were already complete. Basically, upon signing up or logging in, all users were directed to the same list of trips. An overall list of every trip that had been created within the app. Something was wrong! The app was creating new users, but something was wrong with the relationship between users and trips. In some way, the trips weren't recognizing the unique users. I still don't entirely know what was going on. After some tinkering, I made some progress. Users could still see an entire list of all trips that had been created, however they could only edit and delete the trips that they created. Progress!
